# worldeditadditions_core

This mod's purpose is to provide a solid base upon which the rest of WorldEditAdditions can function. Once it is complete, we will be able to mark our dependency on `worldedit` itself optional. To get to that point though will still require a significant effort in implementing enhanced versions of all existing WorldEdit commands. If you've got some free time and a great idea for a command, please do open a pull request! :D
