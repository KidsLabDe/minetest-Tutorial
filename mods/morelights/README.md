Minetest mod adding additional lighting nodes.

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

The Morelights modpack adds over 30 lighting and accessory nodes to suit
various styles of builds, both interior and exterior. Includes basic light
blocks, modern and historical-style lighting, and customizable street lamps.

The modpack is lightweight, with only about **60 kB** of media, including 3D
models.

Some nodes (ceiling lights, bar lights, poles) can be rotated to serve
different purposes.

Morelights currently supports Minetest Game, MineClone 2, and Hades Revisited.
