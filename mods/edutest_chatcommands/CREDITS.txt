These people (in alphabetical order) provided me with valuable insights on
what would improve the usability of Minetest in educational contexts:

* Heiko Idensen
* Birgit Lachner
* Andrzej Pie≈Ñkowski
* Alan Stewart

Many thanks to go to every one of them, as this project would probably be
way less useful without them.
